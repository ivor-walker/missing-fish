First assign the different algorithm parts to each group member:

# Initialization Step
Narayan Murti

# Expectation Step
Lee Scott

# Maximization Step
Yi Zhang

# Testing Convergence Step
Ivor Walker



Then revise and improve everyone's code thorugh commits and team meetings:

# Improved converger function
Narayan

# Fixed Log Likelihood function
Ivor

# Fully fixed converger function
Lee

# Improved efficiency of Initialisation function
Lee

# Added comments
Narayan

# integrated system time and improved overall runtime
Ivor

# Fixed comments, some variables, and various functions
Yi

# Worked on Help File
Narayan, Yi


Build Data Generator

# Data Generator file
Lee



Build diagram of algorithm design


Write the report, with each person collaborating most on the function they worked the most on.
