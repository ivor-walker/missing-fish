Description: Performs the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) Algorithm on Fish Lengths Data 
    that has age groups assigned to only a portion of the data. Function teamEM performs 
    all steps of the optimisation in one call, returning the optimised mu, sigma, and 
    labmda parameters for Age groups 1, 2, and 3.
